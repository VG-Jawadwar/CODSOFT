 **# Codsoft Internship Tasks**

This repository showcases the C++ projects I completed during my internship at Codsoft. It covers fundamental C++ concepts, problem-solving techniques, and the application of pointers in data management.

## Table of Contents

1. Guess the Number Game: guess_the_number/
2. Simple Calculator: simple_calculator/
3. To-Do List (Pointers): to_do_list/

## Project Details

**1. Guess the Number Game:**

* Engages the user in a number-guessing challenge.
* Provides hints to guide the user towards the correct answer.
* Tracks the number of guesses taken.
* Offers a congratulatory message upon success.

**2. Simple Calculator:**

* Performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
* Handles user input and displays results.
* Implements error handling for invalid input.

**3. To-Do List (Pointers):**

* Creates, manages, and stores a list of tasks.
* Allows users to:
    * Add new tasks with descriptions.
    * Mark tasks as completed.
    * View pending and completed tasks.
    * Edit existing tasks.
    * Delete tasks.
* Utilizes pointers to dynamically manage task data.
* Offers optional persistence to save the to-do list between sessions.

## Building and Running

**Prerequisites:**

* A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)

**Instructions:**

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory of the desired project.
3. Use the following command to compile the code:

  
  ** g++ main.cpp -o <output_filename>**
  

4. Run the executable:

  
  ** ./<output_filename>**
  

## Additional Notes

* Each project directory contains its own README file with more specific instructions and details.
* Feel free to explore, experiment, and provide feedback!

**I hope these projects demonstrate my understanding of C++ fundamentals and problem-solving skills. I'm grateful to Codsoft for providing this learning opportunity.**
